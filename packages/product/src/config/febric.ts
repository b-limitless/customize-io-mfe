Reflectance: Reflectance measures the amount of light reflected by 
a fabric at a particular wavelength or range of wavelengths.
It is usually expressed as a percentage, ranging from 0% 
(no light reflected, complete absorption) 
to 100% (all light reflected, no absorption).
*/

Luminance: Luminance refers to the perceived brightness of a 
fabric, taking into account the sensitivity of the human 
eye to different wavelengths of light. 
It is measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m²) or nits.
